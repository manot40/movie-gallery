## Getting Started

_Make sure you already had NodeJS ver >= 16 installed_. If you don't have NodeJS installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- First, clone this repo.
- Second, install dependency, by default I'm using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). (_It's encouraged to use pnpm_) But still you can use any package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

```bash
pnpm install
# or
yarn
# or
npm install
```

- Third, copy `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill the line with required config mentioned in the `.env.example` file.
- Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
